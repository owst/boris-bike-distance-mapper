# TODO:

- Get GMaps to display on page
- Download/parse TFL bike API
- Plot points of docking stations
- Calculate road-only route map between all stations (too large?)
- Determine low/avg/high speed for bike (add variance for traffic?)
- Traffic lights API for stoppages?
- For given docking station, show all routes to other docking stations
- Center on my position.
