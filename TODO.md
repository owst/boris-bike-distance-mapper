# TODO:

- Determine low/avg/high speed for bike (add variance for traffic?)
- Traffic lights API for stoppages?
- Use r-tree rather than looping all stations, e.g.: https://github.com/leaflet-extras/RTree
- Show info box for route details
- Button to show/hide other stations
- Show colour key
- Change colours when selected station from available bikes to available stations
