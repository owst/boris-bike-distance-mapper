# TODO:

- Periodically download/parse/JSON-ify the TFL XML.
- Calculate road-only route map between all stations (too large?)
- Determine low/avg/high speed for bike (add variance for traffic?)
- Traffic lights API for stoppages?
- For given docking station, show all routes to other docking stations
    - Within X distance/Y time or so.
    - Once one chosen, give route?
